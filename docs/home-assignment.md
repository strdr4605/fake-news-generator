# Home Assignment: Fake News Generator

## Overview

Build a full-stack application that scrapes real news articles from multiple sources, transforms them into satirical/fake versions using an LLM, displays them in a news website UI, and provides a chat interface to ask structured questions about each article.

## Time Estimation

4 hours. You are expected (and encouraged) to use AI tools. What matters is your ability to make good decisions, ship working software, and explain your tradeoffs.

## The Task

### 1. News Scraper (Backend)

Build a scraper that collects articles from these public RSS feeds:
- https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml (New York Times)
- https://feeds.npr.org/1001/rss.xml (NPR News)
- https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss (The Guardian)

For each article, extract: title, description/snippet, source name, publish date, and original URL.
Store raw articles in the database. Scraping should run on demand via an API trigger.

### 2. Fake News Transformer (Backend)

For each scraped article, generate a satirical/fake version using the OpenAI API:
- Transform the title and description into a humorous or absurd version while keeping it recognizable
- Store both original and fake versions, linked together in the database
- The transformation should be asynchronous - don't block the scraping pipeline

**Important:** The OpenAI API key will be provided as an environment variable. Do NOT commit it to the repository.

### 3. News Website UI (Frontend)

Build a news feed interface that displays the fake articles:
- News feed - list of fake articles with title, snippet, source, and date
- Article detail view - full fake article with a toggle to show the original
- Filtering - by source
- All data is persisted in the database - refreshing the page or restarting the app shows the same articles

### 4. Chat Interface (Frontend + Backend)

For each article, provide a chat panel where the user can ask structured questions such as:
- "Summarize this article"
- "What are the key entities mentioned?" (people, companies, locations)
- "How was the original article changed?"

Chat history is persisted per article in the database. Queries are handled by the backend.

## Technical Requirements

- **Frontend:** TypeScript. Style it enough to be usable.
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python. Your choice - justify it.
- **Database:** Relational database. Must have a proper schema with migrations.
- **LLM Integration:** We will provide an OpenAI API key. You may use any model available through the OpenAI API.
- **Docker:** docker-compose to spin up the full stack with one command.

## What We Evaluate

1. **Database schema design** - How do you model articles, sources, transformations, and chat history?
2. **API design** - Endpoint structure for scraping, articles, and chat
3. **Async pipeline** - How do you orchestrate the scrape-to-display flow?
4. **LLM integration** - How do you interact with external LLM APIs?
5. **Frontend component structure** - News feed, article detail, chat panel, state management
6. **Error handling** - What happens when things go wrong?
7. **Code organization** - Separation of concerns, project structure, readability
8. **AI-assisted development** - What tools did you use? What was your workflow? Which parts were AI-generated vs hand-written? How did you validate and review AI output?

## Submission

1. **GitHub repo** - public, with a README containing setup instructions
2. **15-minute Loom video** explaining:
   - A quick demo of the working app
   - Your DB schema design and the scrape-to-display pipeline
   - How you handle LLM integration
   - Key architectural decisions and tradeoffs
   - What would you improve with more time
   - Where and how you used AI tools, and what you wrote/reviewed yourself

## Bonus (only if time allows)

- Scheduled scraping (cron or background job)
- Article similarity detection (avoid scraping near-duplicates from different sources)
- Streaming LLM responses in the chat interface

## Important Notes

- Data persistence is a core requirement. All articles, transformations, and chat messages must survive app restarts.
- Do not commit the OpenAI API key to your repository. Use environment variables and document the setup in your README.
- The app must run with a single `docker-compose up` command. We will test this first.
- Focus on working software over polish. A functional app with rough edges beats a beautiful UI that doesn't work end-to-end.
- Be prepared to defend your decisions. In the follow-up interview, we will ask about your architecture, tradeoffs, and what you would change.
